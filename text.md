# Work Deeply
- don't be the victim of your environment be the architecture of it.
## Will Power

These results are bad news for this rule’s goal of helping you cultivate a deep
work habit. They tell us that you can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do
anything but work deeply throughout the day, and if you’re like the German subjects
from the Hofmann and Baumeister study, these competing desires will often win out.

You might respond at this point that you will succeed where these subjects failed
because you understand the importance of depth and will therefore be more rigorous in
your will to remain concentrated. This is a noble sentiment, but the decades of
research that preceded this study underscore its futility.

A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about
willpower: You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.

Your will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character that you can deploy without limit; it’s instead like a muscle that tires. This is why the subjects in the Hofmann and Baumeister study had such a hard time fighting desires—over time these distractions drained their finite pool of willpower until they could no longer resist. The same will happen to you, regardless of your intentions—unless, that is, you’re smart about your habits.

- and to be that you have to move beyond good intention and add **routines and rituals.** to focus your will power in the deep work itself.

Trying to switch from distracted web browsing to focused work drains willpower and often fails. However, establishing routines with dedicated times and places for deep work reduces the willpower needed, making success more likely.

## Path To Deep Work

Attempting to schedule deep work in an ad hoc fashion is not an effective way to manage your limited willpower. so you got to set up plan and in order to do that you need to decide on your depth philosophy. there are many different ways to integrate deep work into your schedule, and it’s therefore worth taking the time to find an approach that makes sense for you.

### 1. The monastic Philosophy

- Eliminate or drastically reduce shallow obligations.
- focus almost entirely on deep work (academics, authors).

### 2. The bimodal Philosophy

- dividing your time into dedicating clear stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open.
- Ideal for people who can dedicate entire days/weeks to depth, then shift back (e.g., professors, researchers).

### 3. Rhythmic Philosophy

- setting daily routine for deep work blocks.
- It may not be as intense as the bimodal method but is more consistent.

### **4. Journalist Philosophy**

- Drop into deep work whenever time allows, like a journalist writing between breaking stories.
- This requires high skill, confidence, and experience with deep work transitions.

## Rituals

- An often-overlooked observation about those who use their minds to create valuable things is that they’re rarely **haphazard in their work habits.**
- when you set ritualize your work you make it **easier to enter the deep work state and keep the willpower to doing the actual work.**
- Waiting for inspiration is a trap. **Serious creators rely on consistent rituals,** not mood.
- Effective rituals should answer
    - **What** is the goal of it.
    - **Where** you'll work and **for how long.**
    - **How** you’ll work once you start.
    - **How** you’ll support your focus (e.g., with breaks, snacks, environment).
- To make the most out of your deep work session, build rituals with **strictness**.
- providing your mind with the structure and commitment it needs to slip into the state of focus where you can begin to create things that matter.

## The Grand Gesture

- by making radical change to our normal environment, perhaps with significant investment of effort or money to support deep work task, you increase the priority of that task, this boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy. The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand.
- These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.

## Don’t Work Alone

consider the use of collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level. At the same time, don’t lionize this quest for interaction and positive randomness to the point where it crowds out the unbroken concentration ultimately required to wring something useful out of the swirl of ideas all around us.

## Execute Like A Business

- its the way from ***What*** to ***How -* Using the Four Discipline of Execution 4XD.**

### 1. Focus on the widely important

- the more you try to do the less you actually accomplish. execution should be aimed to small number of **widely important goal**.
- This simplicity will help focus an organization’s energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results.
- having goal affect more than the idea of spending hours of doing the thing. in this way you wont say no to distraction instead you will say yes to goals which shift your focus to work.

### 2.  Act on the lead Measures

- Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success.
- there two type of metrics for this purpose:
    - **Lag measures** describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve “the result”.
    - **Lead measures**, measure the new behaviours that will drive success on the lag measures ” the causes”.
- this help with deliberate practice.

### 3. keep a Compelling Scoreboard

- where you track the hours spent and results produced.
- People play differently when they’re keeping score.
- This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures. even when other demands vie for their attention.
- It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation.

### 4. Create a Cadence of Accountability

- for reviewing, reflecting and improving.

## Be Lazy

- Downtime aids insights.
- Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply.
- gives clarity and avoid burn out.
- When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done.
