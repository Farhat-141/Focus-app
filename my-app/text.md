## Motion VS Taking action
- people often mistake the difference between being in motion and taking action they sound similar but they are not, here is the difference.
    
    motion is more about the feeling, like preparing for a project or setting a workout plan 
    
    but action means doing the actual thing.
    
    in other words ..
    
    when you are in motion you are planning, strategizing, and learning these all are a good thing but they do not produce an outcome. on the other hand Actions are the type of behaviours that lead to progress.
    
    ex:
    
    - If I outline 20 ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually write and publish an article, that’s action.
    - If I email 10 new leads for my business and start conversations with them, that’s motion. If they actually buy something and turn into a customer, that’s action.
    - If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.
    - If I go to the gym and ask about getting a personal trainer, that’s motion. If I actually step under the bar and start squatting, that’s action.
    - If I study for a test or prepare for a research project, that’s motion. If I actually take the test or write my research paper, that’s action.
    
    ## Why people find themselves in motion
    
    - And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.
        
        Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. 
        
        When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.
        
    
    ## Ideas for taking actions
    
    - **set a schedule for your action.**
        
        For ongoing goals and lifestyle changes, I think this is the best approach. Set a schedule for your actions and stick to it.
        
    - **Pick a date to shift you from motion to action.**
        
        For some goals, setting a daily or weekly schedule doesn’t work as well.
        
        This is the case if you’re doing something that is only going to happen once: like releasing your new book, or launching a new product, or taking a big exam, or submitting a major project.
        
        These things require some planning up front (motion). They also require plenty of action to complete them. For example, you could set a schedule each week to write each chapter of your book. But for the book launch itself, you could spend weeks or months planning different venues, locations, and so on.
        
        In a situation like this, I find that it’s best to simply pick a date. Put something on the calendar. Make it public. This is when X is happening.
        
        For big projects or one–time goals, I think this is the best approach. Force yourself out of motion and into action by setting a hard deadline.     

## Deliberate practice
- refer to one’s ability to practice things attentionally and with the purpose of specific improvement. and the key to deliberate practice comes down to “ FEEDBACKs ”, which lead to more attention to specific action.

Define Goal → Absolute Focus → Immediate feedback → Desire

## pareto principle 80/20.
- focus on the most important thing that brings the highest value.
